This dataset (AK_T25M30O20) contains data from a soil incubation experiment performed at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in March 2014. The soil used was sampled at the Caribou Poker Research Watershed in Alaska, at a spruce forest site. The incubation was ran for 35 days with an automated soil chamber system with controled temperature (25 degrees C), moisture (30% water content), and oxygen levels (20%). This dataset has not been published yet.

The columns in the data are:
Day: The number of days after the experiment was started.
SoilColumn: id of the soil column.  
eCO2: The rate of CO2 production from each incubation column. Units are in ug-CO2-C g-1 day-1.

Each soil column had an initial dry weight of 450 g. The carbon concentration measured in three replicates were: 0.04683975, 0.04703255, 0.04687287 in g C g-1 soil.
